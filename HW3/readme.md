neural networks are artificial networks trying to imitate brain learning method, that gained popularity due to their capabality to solve so many problems in different fields.
in first part of this assignment i implemented a cnn network using keras library . in second part we were asked to train a network to approximate sin function.

## cnn using keras
as said in first we want to implement a cnn network . target dataset is cifar10 and we aim to perform classification on this dataset .

## approximating sin function 
networks with one hidden layers with finite number of neurons can approxiamte continuous functions. i trained simple network using tanh as activation function with one hidden layer .
