This assignment consist of two questions.first one is about naive bayes and second one is about policy iteration each will be described in their section.

## Naive bayes
Naive bayes is a statiscal algorithm which uses conditional probabilty to predict.in this section i implanted this algorithm from scratch in order to classify [mushroom dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).in naive bayes algorithm first we calculate prior probabilty for each class then for prediction we just calculate likelihood of each label for an input and predict according to it

## policy iteration
policy iteration is an algorithm in reinforcement learning which is model based. in this section i used this algorithm to simulate a situation where we got two companies each with their rate of new contracts and old contracts being ended and we can transfer customers from one to other. i used policy iteration to find optimal policy to optimize income of both sides.i also used different values for discount rate and charged transfer between two companies in order to simulate different situations.
